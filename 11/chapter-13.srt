Chapter 13.
Returning original mtime from an up to date Target.

2
00:00:04,205 --> 00:00:12,571
So, that was one case, we did the case where when you are forced
to rebuild yourself, you return your regeneration time.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,622
If you are already up to date you
should return your target, your original time,

4
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:25,291
so that you don't imply that you're newer than
you are and force things downstream to get rebuilt.

5
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:28,137
So where was that; lazy build exe.

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,611
When the dependencies are newer than
the target it returns a new time at the file.

7
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:42,285
When the dependencies are older than the target
it returns the mtime of the unmodified file.

8
00:00:53,154 --> 00:01:04,285
In that case we expect
target.build to equal the target time.

9
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:10,285
[Silence]

10
00:01:10,354 --> 00:01:14,731
So... It's not.

11
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,497
TS: Do you think this was a rather unfair test
because actually those two times would be the same

12
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:25,782
if you hadn't run the instructions,
the mtime of the file wouldn't have changed.

13
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:30,194
So you've set up the test in such a way
that you've assumed that the mtime changes.

14
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:37,611
JC: What I'm testing, by accident, is that
it returns the result of the second mtime call,

15
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:45,817
which I've said in the thing is
the original time plus 10 minutes.

16
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:50,560
But what it's done is returned me...

17
00:01:50,742 --> 00:01:58,811
Expected 1712, got 1722 just because
it's returning the value of the second call.

18
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:02,045
TS: Which would be fine, but it's not fine.

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,577
JC: No. [Laughter]

20
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:10,080
So, is that what I really mean?
Is that an accident or is it what I really mean?

21
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,645
That it returns the result of the second mtime call.

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,960
Because what else can you say; you're
not actually interacting with the system.

23
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,400
You're not running these commands;
we're not actually changing any files.

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,017
Is there some other way that I can say
"it should return the same time as before"?

25
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:35,417
I guess, if you decided not to run the build, you
don't need to run the File.mtime a second time.

26
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,377
TS: Right. I suppose it does depend on whether
you care about mtime being run twice or not.

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,108
Do you feel that it's important it only
gets run as many times as necessary?

28
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:55,337
JC: Well, this feature that we're working on is all
about doing as little work as possible I suppose.

29
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:03,360
I mean it is a very cheap operation, but it
still hits disc, and you know hitting disc is bad.

30
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm probably worrying about it more than I ought to.

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,560
The question that I actually have is how
you test this in an accurate way.

32
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:16,320
It's not just working by
accident, it's actually correct.

33
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:21,017
TS: Is it possible to get it to have the
behaviour that you specified in your test

34
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,091
or are you gonna have to relax your
test in order to do anything?

35
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:32,137
JC: Well I could stub it so that it
returns the same value both times

36
00:03:32,217 --> 00:03:38,754
but then if it does that, from reading the test
you can't tell which of those values it's returning.

37
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,217
So that is not helpful.

38
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:51,611
I could make it so the code caches the first call to mtime
and returns that if it decides not to do any work.

39
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,057
TS: Right. Oh, so mean that you could have an instance
variable where your initial mtime gets stored

40
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:04,491
and then if it does the build it updates that mtime
and returns whichever one of those 'won'.

41
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,400
JC: Yes.. I think I'll do that.

42
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:17,131
I've accidentally swapped my
terminals around. Nevermind!

43
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:25,074
So if I go back into lib/fakemake/target.

44
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,457
We can make this just return mtime.

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:42,891
Then we can assign that
to an instance variable there.

46
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:47,862
And make that an instance variable there.

47
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:59,714
Then at the end of this we can say
mtime = file.mtime with the pathname.

48
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:07,154
This will now implicitly return mtime [laughter]
because it's the last thing that build calls.

49
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,097
But I want build to be the
recipe of the steps that you do.

50
00:05:13,302 --> 00:05:17,657
[Silence]

51
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,062
Expected two times with arguments.
Yeah, so that's where I've got hmm...

52
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,662
TS: Is this the change you had to
make to un-break the test before?

53
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:34,320
JC: Yes, maybe I should remove that
and fix this specifically where it is done.

54
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:40,777
TS: Well previously you amended your test
to say that it always receives mtime twice.

55
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,594
but now you've improved your
code so that it only receives it once

56
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,451
in a case where it only needs to receive it once.
So you've optimized away the second of those mtimes.

57
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,617
JC: Yes.

58
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:57,314
OK, let's try something else.

59
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:07,462
In this case it's called twice.

60
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:13,451
[Silence]

61
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:20,491
We could make it so this is defined
to be called once in this scenario.

62
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:28,708
And it just returns that.

63
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:37,817
So when the dependencies are newer it calls
mtime twice and returns the second return value.

64
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:42,708
In this case it only returns it once.

65
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,560
No, wait, that's not actually true, it does...

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,982
No, it only calls mtime again if the things
are newer, so this ought to be fine.

67
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:57,291
Time always makes me confused.

68
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
TS: Where's this failure coming from?

69
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:01,817
[James thinks]

70
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,394
JC: There is probably a test...
So we've stubbed it out globally.

71
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,108
We said it was allowed to be called twice.

72
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:15,474
This is the test that checks the
mtime of its own file, that's that one.

73
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,131
TS: But you only put the twice
in there to stop that test breaking.

74
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:27,474
JC: That's true. But now I've specified it more strongly
in those tests, this ought to not be necessary.

75
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:33,554
TS: Well then the change you made in the the implementation was
so that it doesn't get called twice unless it needs to be.

76
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:36,137
JC: Yes.

77
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:44,320
OK, so everything's green, so we should
check what we've done and make a commit.

78
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,011
A few things have changed:
we've made build return mtime.

79
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:55,988
We have then used that
to make it skip building itself.

80
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:59,302
And then we've made a new mtime at the end.

81
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:06,582
Oh, there's that method I extracted that
isn't actually needed. Let's get rid of that.

82
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:11,954
[Silence]

83
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:17,931
(That's not needed)

84
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,262
Yes. So we've returned mtime.
Made it skip if everything's up to date.

85
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,491
And everything else is tests.

86
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,120
OK.
