00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:02,331
Welcome to Peer to Peer

2
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:05,931
where you can hone your skills
by watching live coding videos.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,742
Our guest today is James Coglan.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,360
Author of JavaScript Testing Recipes.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,914
And creator of open source projects such
as Faye and web socket driver.

6
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:19,577
Our host is Tom Stuart.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,365
And the challenge that he has set
for James is called Building a build tool.

8
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:28,360
Chapter 01.
The Challenge.

9
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:31,600
Tom Stuart: So James would you
like to start by reading the challenge?

10
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:33,748
James Coglan: Sure, so the challenge is:

11
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:39,320
Create a tool for automating the
steps required to build a javascript project.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,411
A sample project is
supplied with coffescript files.

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,651
These need to be compiled to
javascript then minified and concatenated.

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,097
The build tool should be able to accept

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,582
generalised instructions for
carrying out each of these steps.

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,440
Where possible the build tool should be lazy, only
running steps if they if they produce fresh output.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:08,617
So this is quite a lot like the make build
system so I'll be taking inspiration from that.

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,165
Like figuring out how you implement those steps,

19
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:16,994
if you were to do that sort of thing yourself.

20
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,897
There's coffeescript,
so we'll need the coffee compiler.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:32,502
And it has to be minified so I'll
use uglify.js for that... and concatenated.

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:39,817
either uglify will do that, or I'll use cat,
or something like that. [James thinks]

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,925
But I suppose a good thing to do
first is to run these things by hand.

24
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:43,531
TS: Right.

25
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,320
JC: And see that they work
before we try to automate them.
